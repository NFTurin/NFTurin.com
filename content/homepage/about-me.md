Here we are, Julius and Francis, two crazy friends, based in Turin. We started out as two guys who had a love for drawing. Soon after we realized that we both shared a similar interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Then Opensea and the Crypto - Apes - friends came and the NFT revolution started. And we were overwhelmed.

We spent the first half of 2022 thinking, designing, researching ... Inspirations, suggestions, ideas to be translated into digital projects.

Starting from July 2022, we started making our ideas and ambitions concrete. We have recruited 3 other friends to join the team and now the game is starting to get tough.
