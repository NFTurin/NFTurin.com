Our team is currently working on three new projects: three NFT collections that we will release between now and the end of 2022. We are all very excited and full of creative energy!

## Our 1st collection

Our first collection will be particularly gothic.

We cannot anticipate much details but we consider it our pilot project and therefore will consist of a total of up to 200 original pieces, hand drawn and digitally remastered.

## Ongoing projects

The second collection will likely be launched next October, it will have a more cartoonish inspiration and will be very colorful and funny. It will consist of about 350-400 original subjects. They will be minted on the Polygon blockchain and available on Opensea and Rarible. Smart contract, source files and images will all be on decentralized storage on the blockchain.

The first two pilot projects will be used to accumulate the experience needed to launch what is currently our most ambitious project: a collection of at least 10,000 subjects combined with a fantasy football game.
